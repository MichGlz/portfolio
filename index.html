        <p>
          I’m born and raised in Mexico City. I grew up in a heartwarming family with tree siblings and parents that encouraged my creativity and curiosity to experiment with my ideas and different technology. From a early age my father showed me how
          to fix my toys, instead of buying new. This is a quality I’ve had with me all my life, and as a child I un sampled my toys, in order to sample it again.
        </p>

        <p>I’ve been a boy scout with my brother and father from a early age, and the brotherhood and discipline I’ve learned in my many years there is fundamental in my way of being there for my friends and my loyalty as a employee.</p>

        <p>
          As a young adult I studied in the university in Mexico City, and had different jobs at the same time. As a bike messenger I meet a danish guy, and we became friends. After some years he starter a furniture company, and one thing let to
          another and I left Mexico in 2013 to join the company as a employee in Denmark.

          I worked there as a project developer being specialized in the famous “Acapulco” chair from Mexico. While working in the company I meet my wife. We moved together in Copenhagen and got married in the summer of 2018. The year after our baby
          boy came to us, and we’re yet again expecting a child in the beginning of 2021. I decided to follow a dream about studying, so I applied for MDD at KEA in 2020.
